# ðŸŽ¬ IMDB Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

A multi-model sentiment analysis dashboard built with Streamlit and PyTorch. This app lets you paste any movie review and instantly compare predictions across multiple deep learning architectures: RNN, LSTM, GRU, GloVe, and Transformer.  This projects falls in the NLP model series where different NLP more tasted to give movie review basing on user's comment
